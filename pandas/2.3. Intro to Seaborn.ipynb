    "This distinction is important for making a plot because numeric variables have an inherent numbering and spacing to them: 5 is larger than 2, and the distance from 3 to 4 is the same as the distance from 100 to 101. Categorical data don't have this: is \"romance\" larger than \"comedy\"? How far should \"horror\" and \"romance\" be from each other?\n",
